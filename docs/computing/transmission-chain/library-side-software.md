# Software Library-Side

(This stuff isn’t on GitHub. Probably not backed up anywhere. Probably should be).

## FM Receiver

## Stereotools (FM)

Access from within URY:

    Terminal command: ssh -L 8080:localhost:8080 [ury@fmstl.ury.york.ac.uk](mailto:ury@fmstl.ury.york.ac.uk)

    The password is the standard (fairly insecure) one

    Then visit [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to visit the stereotools interface

You can change the processing settings here. I have the feeling, if and when we have to restart the receiving software, it reloads the saved settings, and doesn’t save them when you change them on the user interface. There might be a save button somewhere.

[Notes on saved configs….?]
