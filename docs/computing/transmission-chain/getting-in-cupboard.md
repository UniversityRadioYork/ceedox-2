# Getting into the Cupboard

Call Estates. Cameron is very helpful, many other people just are like “urgh you should be putting in planon requests to open the cupboard”. The equipment rack is also locked, we keep the keys _somewhere. Bet you can’t guess where._

Note that if you need to go into the cupboard you shouldn’t touch the DAB transmitter without discussing with MuxNet first. Also let them know if you need to restart the PC, as the DAB feed goes through that too.

You shouldn’t need to get on to the roof, but if you do, you’ll need estates to make sure the gates to the ladder are unlocked, and get security (~~campus safety~~) to de-alarm door E61479 (on the non-emergency number 01904 324444). From the toilet, with the door on your left, go to the windows and turn left, and up the metal steps
