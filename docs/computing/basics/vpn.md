The Uni VPN service can be accessed via [http://webvpn.york.ac.uk](http://webvpn.york.ac.uk) here you can log in, and set up Network Connect for your computer (On Mac you must use safari to download this).

Once downloaded run Network Connect and sign in. All your internet connections will now pass through the VPN and act as if you are coming from york campus.

SSH access is possible to study bedrooms, when connecting via the VPN. This is the only way to SSH into study bedrooms unless you are within the same subnet.
