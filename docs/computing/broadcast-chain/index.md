# Broadcast Chain

This is where you will find info about the broadcast chain at URY, especially where it related to Computing. The line between Engineering and Computing is blury, so this guide should be useful to both teams.

The section should give you at least a general jist of what is connected to what, with helpful information explaining why and where to look for more information/poking around. Hopefully it should be understandable to all

In essence, URY has a hybrid digital-analogue broadcast chain. This is for legacy and convenience reasons, with more parts of the chain becoming digital over time.
