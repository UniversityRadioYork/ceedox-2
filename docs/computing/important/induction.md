# Computing Team Induction

Welcome to URY Computing Team! We hope that your stay here is a fun, productive and--dare we say--//educational// one!

This page is basically a checklist/rundown of all the things that need to be done before you're a fully fledged, ready-to-go computing type person. Some of it is stuff we need to do, and hopefully by the time you get to read this it should have been done for you, but you'll have to do a bit of it too.

## New user account

Firstly, you'll need a user account for every computer you'll need to touch. We'll set these up for you.

## Development server password

Secondly, in order to access our Web resources (the bug tracker, development website, continuous integration/build server, etc etc yadda), we'll need a username and password from you. (This is separate from the new user account).

## Reading list

Yes, we _know_ you want to get stuck in immediately. But, before you do anything, we really do recommend that you at least acknowledge the bits of the Computing wiki labelled **Important Things** and **Computing Team Basics**, especially the important stuff. Something in there could save your life.
