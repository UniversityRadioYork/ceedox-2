Welcome to **Ceedox 2**, the URY internal documentation wiki for technical teams.

This is _not_ to be confused with [Team Wiki](http://ury.org.uk/wiki/), which is the general-purpose open-access wiki for use throughout URY.

!!! Note
    Do not put any sensitive information on Ceedox, as it is publicly available.
    Passwords should be on Vault, anything else sensitive should be either on Netbox or the team Google Drive.
